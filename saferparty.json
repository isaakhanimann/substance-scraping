The effect of alcohol is influenced by the amount consumed, the type of alcohol (sugary and/or carbonated), the period of consumption and individual factors (age, sex, weight). The blood alcohol concentration is measured in parts per thousand (‰). The higher the alcohol concentration in the blood, the stronger the effect of alcohol.",
        "generalRisks": "Small amounts of alcohol generally have a relaxing and exhilarating effect, a general feeling of well-being spreads, fears are reduced and sociability increases. The consumption of larger amounts can lead to balance and speech disorders, visual disturbances (double vision or tunnel vision), stomach pain, nausea to vomiting, headaches (hangover) due to dehydration, loss of control and blackouts. There is a risk of accidents due to overestimation of one's own abilities and reduced ability to react. High doses can lead to hypothermia or overheating, deep sleep and coma. Very high doses (blood alcohol concentration of 3-4‰) can be life-threatening.\nBinge drinking, i.e. the consumption of a large amount of alcohol in a very short time, causes the blood alcohol content to rise particularly quickly and strongly. This can quickly lead to alcohol poisoning. Consequences can be: comatose state, memory lapses (film tears), deactivation of important reflexes (danger of choking when vomiting, danger of freezing to death when cold) as well as epileptic seizures. There is also an increased risk of thrombosis, high or low blood pressure, respiratory depression and sudden cardiac death.",

Alcohol is a co-carcinogen, i.e. it significantly increases the carcinogenic effect of other substances (e.g. nicotine).\nAlcohol can produce a dependence with psychological and physical symptoms. Typical withdrawal symptoms are trembling, sweating, nausea and vomiting up to epileptic seizures.

        "dosageRemark": "Because of the varying purity (the amphetamine content varies from almost 0 % to almost 100 %!), dosing is difficult and the risk of overdose is high.

At high doses: hallucinations, circulatory failure, strokes as well as kidney, liver and heart failure and states of deep unconsciousness. An often underestimated danger is the rise in body temperature, which can lead to dehydration of the body. In high doses, acute amphetamine psychosis can occur. Signs of this are hallucinations in the form of colour spots and with features of schizophrenia. The risk of such an acute mental disorder increases with consumption over several days and/or if high doses are taken and food intake and sleep are neglected over a longer period of time. Such an experience usually normalises after sufficient sleep. During and after coming down: extreme need for sleep, exhaustion, strong feeling of hunger,depressive mood, irritability, etc.",

Frequent use of amphetamine not infrequently leads to physical deficiency symptoms (e.g. calcium deficiency, which can lead to bone and tooth problems) and to psychological problems such as dejection or listlessness. Regular and high-dose use can lead to constant restlessness (but also persistent fatigue), sleep and circulatory disorders as well as anxiety disorders up to persistent amphetamine psychosis with paranoid delusions. In addition, high blood pressure, cardiac arrhythmias, weight loss, skin inflammations (\"speed pimples\"), stomach problems as well as liver and kidney damage and cramps are possible.

CBD also has analgesic, sedative and narcotic effects.\nThe main cannabis active substances THC and CBD dock in the body to the cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2. This activates the body's own messenger substance endocannabinoid. This has a relaxing, appetite-stimulating, calming and pain-relieving effect. Feelings are intensified, serenity and/or groundless cheerfulness set in. The experience of time is changed, usually slowed down. In high doses and CBD-free varieties, cannabis can have hallucinogenic effects. Since it is usually consumed together with tobacco, the joint-typical effect is an interaction between cannabis and tobacco. This usually leads to an intensification and prolongation of the effect, as tobacco inhibits the degradation of endocannabinoids. ",

In the case of chronic use, there is a danger of loss of reality; latent psychoses can be triggered. In addition, long-term impairment of short-term memory and the ability to motivate oneself is possible.\nSmoking, especially when mixed with tobacco, increases susceptibility to respiratory problems (bronchitis, tracheitis, pneumonia, etc.) when consumed chronically.

Due to its stimulating, wakefulness-promoting properties, modafinil is consumed by healthy people as a so-called \"smart drug\" or \"cognitive enhancer\".According to user reports, modafinil has a much more subtle effect than other stimulants and does not trigger comparable states of intoxication. Modafinil causes less physical restlessness and the sleep-wake rhythm is less disturbed.\nA mood-lifting and euphoric effect is controversial.

In addition, modafinil can impair the effectiveness of oral contraceptives! Therefore, the use of additional contraceptive methods is recommended during intake. Further risks are cardiovascular diseases such as cardiac arrhythmias, diseases of the heart muscles, cardiac insufficiency and/or high blood pressure. Furthermore, the consumption of modafinil can have an effect on the psyche and trigger hostility, aggression ,psychoses/psychotic disorders, depression, insomnia, up to delusions and/or anxiety.\nSymptoms of overdose with modafinil alone or in combination with other medicines: Insomnia; central nervous symptoms (restlessness, disorientation, confusion, agitation, hallucinations); nausea, diarrhoea; palpitations, high blood pressure, chest pain, slow heartbeat.",

        "effects": "Synthetic cannabinoids are similar in their mode of action to the cannabinoid Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which occurs naturally in the hemp plant. Like THC, synthetic cannabinoids dock onto the cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2 in the brain and other organs of the human body. Originally, synthetic cannabinoids were developed as therapeutic agents for pain relief. However, it has proven difficult to separate the desired therapeutic properties from the undesirable psychoactive effect.\nThe effect of synthetic cannabinoids is many times stronger than naturally occurring THC (depending on the substance, it can be 50 to 100 times stronger). This means that much less substance is needed to have an effect. Therefore, the risk of overdose is also very high. In addition, the effect and duration of action of each individual synthetic cannabinoid varies. Since synthetic cannabinoids have hardly been researched, the effect cannot be fully assessed.\nUsers report a cannabis-like feeling of contentment and deep relaxation. There may also be changes in auditory, visual and haptic (touch) sensations. Some synthetic cannabinoids also appear to be mildly stimulating, and users report stimulating and drive-enhancing effects.",

        "generalRisks": "The risks and side effects can vary quite a bit depending on which synthetic cannabinoid has been consumed. The following side effects can occur: Accelerated pulse, rapid heartbeat, high blood pressure, seizures, chest pain, headaches, nausea with vomiting, decrease in mental performance, confusion, delusions, acute psychoses, strong craving, aggressive and violent behaviour, rapid fainting and even heart attack.\nThe use of synthetic cannabinoids often leads to emergency treatment. The Global Drug Survey 2017 showed that synthetic cannabinoids were cited as the second most common substance (after methamphetamine and before alcohol) whose use had led to emergency medical treatment. Several deaths can also be attributed to the use of synthetic cannabinoids.\nIf synthetic cannabinoids are falsely declared and sprayed on CBD weed and sold as cannabis containing THC, risky overdoses and/or strong side effects that pose a health risk can occur even faster. This effect is intensified by the sometimes very uneven distribution of cannabinoids on the flowers.",
