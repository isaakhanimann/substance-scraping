Together with the main active ingredient alcohol, thujone is said to have stimulating and mind-altering effects. In Europe, as in Switzerland, clear limits apply (max. 35 mg thujone per kg alcohol). Caution with chronic use! A thujone overdose manifests itself in seizures and epilepsy-like symptoms.",
        "dosageRemark": "Standard drinks such as 3 dl beer, 1 dl wine or 2 cl spirits contain about 12 g alcohol. The effect of alcohol is influenced by the amount consumed, the type of alcohol (sugary and/or carbonated), the period of consumption and individual factors (age, sex, weight). The blood alcohol concentration is measured in parts per thousand (‰). The higher the alcohol concentration in the blood, the stronger the effect of alcohol.",
        "generalrisks": "Small amounts of alcohol generally have a relaxing and exhilarating effect, a general feeling of well-being spreads, fears are reduced and sociability increases. The consumption of larger amounts can lead to balance and speech disorders, visual disturbances (double vision or tunnel vision), stomach pain, nausea to vomiting, headaches (hangover) due to dehydration, loss of control and blackouts. There is a risk of accidents due to overestimation of one's own abilities and reduced ability to react. High doses can lead to hypothermia or overheating, deep sleep and coma. Very high doses (blood alcohol concentration of 3-4‰) can be life-threatening.\nBinge drinking, i.e. the consumption of a large amount of alcohol in a very short time, causes the blood alcohol content to rise particularly quickly and strongly. This can quickly lead to alcohol poisoning. Consequences can be: comatose state, memory lapses (film tears), deactivation of important reflexes (danger of choking when vomiting, danger of freezing to death when cold) as well as epileptic seizures. There is also an increased risk of thrombosis, high or low blood pressure, respiratory depression and sudden cardiac death.",
        "longtermrisks": "Since alcohol is a cytotoxin, regular heavy consumption can have consequences such as damage to all bodily organs, deficiency symptoms, disorders of the nervous system, coordination of movement and memory functions, and even alcohol-induced dementia. Alcohol is a co-carcinogen, i.e. it significantly increases the carcinogenic effect of other substances (e.g. nicotine).\nAlcohol can produce a dependence with psychological and physical symptoms. Typical withdrawal symptoms are trembling, sweating, nausea and vomiting up to epileptic seizures. On a psychological level, irritability, anxiety disorders, depressive moods and hallucinations may occur. Tolerance develops with regular consumption.",

        "dosageRemark": "Because of the varying purity (the amphetamine content varies from almost 0 % to almost 100 %!), dosing is difficult and the risk of overdose is high. Doses of more than 25 mg of pure amphetamine increase the negative effects. A dose of 50 mg/night should be the maximum, whether snorted or swallowed.",

At high doses: hallucinations, circulatory failure, strokes as well as kidney, liver and heart failure and states of deep unconsciousness. An often underestimated danger is the rise in body temperature, which can lead to dehydration of the body. In high doses, acute amphetamine psychosis can occur. Signs of this are hallucinations in the form of colour spots and with features of schizophrenia. The risk of such an acute mental disorder increases with consumption over several days and/or if high doses are taken and food intake and sleep are neglected over a longer period of time. Such an experience usually normalises after sufficient sleep. During and after coming down: extreme need for sleep, exhaustion, strong feeling of hunger,depressive mood, irritability, etc.",

Frequent use of amphetamine not infrequently leads to physical deficiency symptoms (e.g. calcium deficiency, which can lead to bone and tooth problems) and to psychological problems such as dejection or listlessness. Regular and high-dose use can lead to constant restlessness (but also persistent fatigue), sleep and circulatory disorders as well as anxiety disorders up to persistent amphetamine psychosis with paranoid delusions. In addition, high blood pressure, cardiac arrhythmias, weight loss, skin inflammations (\"speed pimples\"), stomach problems as well as liver and kidney damage and cramps are possible.

CBD also has analgesic, sedative and narcotic effects.\nThe main cannabis active substances THC and CBD dock in the body to the cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2. This activates the body's own messenger substance endocannabinoid. This has a relaxing, appetite-stimulating, calming and pain-relieving effect. Feelings are intensified, serenity and/or groundless cheerfulness set in. The experience of time is changed, usually slowed down. In high doses and CBD-free varieties, cannabis can have hallucinogenic effects. Since it is usually consumed together with tobacco, the joint-typical effect is an interaction between cannabis and tobacco. This usually leads to an intensification and prolongation of the effect, as tobacco inhibits the degradation of endocannabinoids. ",
        "dosageRemark": "The main active ingredient content and the ratio of THC to CBD differ greatly depending on the product. Therefore, the dosage is difficult to determine.

At high doses and varieties with little CBD, circulatory problems up to circulatory collapse, in the worst case paranoia and depressive moods may occur.\nWhen consuming cannabis products, the dosage is more difficult to estimate, making the risks and side effects more unpredictable.",

Symptoms of mild physical dependence may also manifest themselves; in the case of sudden abstinence, sweating, hot/cold shivers, loss of appetite and difficulty falling asleep as well as irritability are possible. In the case of chronic use, there is a danger of loss of reality; latent psychoses can be triggered. In addition, long-term impairment of short-term memory and the ability to motivate oneself is possible.\nSmoking, especially when mixed with tobacco, increases susceptibility to respiratory problems (bronchitis, tracheitis, pneumonia, etc.) when consumed chronically.

When consuming LSD felts, there is a risk of ingesting misdeclared substances, pharmacologically active extenders and/or high-dose felts. The highly variable active substance content of LSD felts can lead to the unintentional ingestion of high doses of LSD, which increase the risk of a negative experience (bad trip). High doses increase the risk even for experienced users. Highly intense psychedelic experiences can be induced, which can be disturbing and frightening. In recent years, we have repeatedly analysed misdeclared LSD felts (felts containing another psychoactive substance instead of LSD). Depending on the substance, such misdeclarations pose a high health risk.",

This release triggers a feeling of euphoria, lightness and light-heartedness. Sight and hearing change, touch and music are felt more intensely, inhibitions are reduced and the need for contact is increased. The effect is described as empathogenic (triggering a feeling of closeness and connection to other people) and entactogenic (touching the inner self, intensifying emotional perception). The simultaneous release of the neurotransmitters noradrenalin and dopamine has a stimulating effect. This reduces the feeling of hunger and thirst as well as tiredness and increases alertness. Body temperature and blood pressure also rise.",

The heart, liver and kidneys are particularly stressed. There is also a risk of life-threatening overheating as body temperature rises and the body becomes dehydrated. In the case of an overdose, hallucinations are possible. When the effect wears off or on the days afterwards, depressive moods may occur.",
        "longtermrisks": "After a consumption experience, the body needs at least 4 weeks to regenerate the serotonin balance. If one does not allow oneself this break in the long term and consumes repeatedly after short breaks, the probability of a permanent restriction of spatial awareness increases. This risk also exists after repeated high doses. Intense and prolonged use of ecstasy can also lead to a change in the serotonin system. A form of dependence with psychological symptoms can develop, especially if ecstasy use is linked to a certain activity, for example if it is always used at parties and partying without ecstasy afterwards is no longer possible. In the case of snorting, the nasal mucous membranes and the nasal wall are damaged. Rectal use can cause irritation in the rectum.",
